title: CEF Nominal Rolls
---

Thanks to the members of the [CEFSG](http://cefresearch.ca/), the Nominal
Rolls of the [Canadian Expeditionary
Force](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Expeditionary_Force) are
available in digital format for researchers to peruse. Unfortunately, unlike
the [Australian Nominal
Rolls](http://www.awm.gov.au/people/roll-search/nominal_rolls/first_world_war/),
they are images, and thus not easily searchable or readable by computer.

This repository contains code for processing and analyzing the Nominal Rolls,
and hopefully will become a simpler way to browse or search (if everything goes
according to plan.)
