{"name":"CEF Nominal Rolls","tagline":"Processing and analyzing the CEF Nominal Rolls","body":"Thanks to the members of the [CEFSG](http://cefresearch.ca/), the Nominal\r\nRolls of the [Canadian Expeditionary\r\nForce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Expeditionary_Force) are\r\navailable in digital format for researchers to peruse. Unfortunately, unlike\r\nthe [Australian Nominal\r\nRolls](http://www.awm.gov.au/people/roll-search/nominal_rolls/first_world_war/),\r\nthey are images, and thus not easily searchable or readable by computer.\r\n\r\nThis repository contains code for processing and analyzing the Nominal Rolls,\r\nand hopefully will become a simpler way to browse or search (if everything goes\r\naccording to plan.)\r\n\r\nNote: Actual Nominal Rolls are not contained in this repository because they\r\nwould far exceed GitHub's hosting quota. Please [see the CEFSG\r\nsite](http://cefresearch.ca/wiki/index.php/Nominal_Rolls) for information on\r\nobtaining the PDFs.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nNominal Rolls are stored locally using [git\r\nannex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/), but due to their size, are not\r\navailable here. You will need to download them yourself from the CEFSG site\r\nabove if you wish to analyze them.\r\n\r\nScripts are written in Python and may require the following:\r\n  * [lxml](http://lxml.de/)\r\n  * [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/)\r\n  * [ReportLab](http://www.reportlab.com/opensource/)\r\n\r\nMost of these can be installed via your package manager or Python distribution.\r\n\r\n## Available Scripts\r\n\r\n`abbyy2pdf.py` converts an ABBYY XML file into a PDF. This script is merely a\r\ntest to see what sort of results the OCR process produced. It is not intended\r\nto produce a professional PDF. Characters may be the wrong size or off the\r\nbaseline, but the result should give a general idea of the result.\r\n\r\n`abbyy2csv.py` converts an ABBYY XML file into a CSV. This script uses the\r\nclustering algorithms of scikit-learn to partition the text data into rows and\r\ncolumns, and produces a tabular CSV result. The defaults parameters will\r\nlikely produce terrible results, though.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
